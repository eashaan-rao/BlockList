## 📄 **Abstract**  
**Linked lists** are a fundamental data structure used in various applications, including **stacks, queues, and trees**. Despite their importance, **novice programmers** often struggle with understanding **insertion, deletion, and memory management** due to their low-level nature.  

💡 **Our Solution:**  
We introduce **BlockList**, an **interactive drag-and-drop game** designed to teach linked list concepts using **visual analogies** instead of traditional code-based explanations.  

🎯 **Key Features:**  
✔️ Hands-on gameplay for **insertion & deletion** of linked list nodes  
✔️ Pattern-based challenges to build **logical thinking**  
✔️ Abstracted concepts to enhance **understanding without syntax barriers**  

**Impact:**  
📝 A survey among **15 first-year undergraduate students** found that **84.88%** agreed the game helped them grasp **basic linked list operations** more effectively!

## **Gameplay Preview**  
> 🏗️ *Arrange the blocks to match the target pattern!*  

🚀 **Drag & Drop Interface** – Intuitive controls to manipulate linked list elements  
🧩 **Engaging Challenges** – Solve puzzles by performing **insertion & deletion**  
📈 **Visual Feedback** – See the impact of your actions in real time

**Descritpion**: _User scenario of Level 4 of BlockList. [A] displays the game's first scene with goal description, block arrangement, a pile of blocks, and a life bar. [B] depicts the scenario when the user takes the wrong step towards the goal. [C] and [D] represent the user's intermediate steps to achieve the goal. [E] shows the final scene where the user achieves the goal and generates the required block arrangement. _
